# OpenCode Agent Rules

## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md), use
your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. They're relevant to the
SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual
  need.
- Follow references and instructions recursively when needed.
- Always test solutions using the command line tool. Do not simply assume your
  solutions to work, verify and validate thoroughly.
